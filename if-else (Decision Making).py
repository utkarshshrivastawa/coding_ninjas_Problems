# Problem statement
# Programming languages have some conditional / decision-making statements that execute when some specific condition is fulfilled.

# If-else is one of the ways to implement them.

# You are given two numbers 'a' and 'b'.
# Compare the numbers and print the relation.
# Print “smaller”, “greater” or “equal” when ‘a’ is smaller than ‘b’, greater than ‘b’, or equal to ‘b’ respectively.

# Example :
# Input: ‘a’ = 5 and ‘b’ = 3
# Output: greater
# Explanation: Since ‘a’ (= 5) is greater than ‘b’ (= 3), we are printing “greater”.
# Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
# Sample Input 1:
# 5 3


# Sample Output 1:
# greater


# Explanation of sample input 1 :
# Since ‘a’ (= 5) is greater than ‘b’ (= 3), we are printing “greater”.


# Sample Input 2:
# 2 2
# Sample Output 2:
# equal
# Explanation of sample input 2 :
# Since ‘a’ (= 2) is equal to ‘b’ (= 2), we are printing “equal”.
# Expected time complexity :
# The expected time complexity is O(1).


# Constraints :
# -10 ^ 5 <= ‘a’ <= 10 ^ 5
# -10 ^ 5 <= ‘b’ <= 10 ^ 5

# Time limit: 1 second

code : 
from typing import *

def compareIfElse(a: int, b: int):
    # Write your code here
    if a > b:
        return 'greater'
    elif a < b:
        return 'smaller'
    else:
        return 'equal'
