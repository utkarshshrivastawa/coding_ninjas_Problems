# Problem statement
# Programming languages have some conditional / decision-making statements that execute when some specific condition is fulfilled.
# Switch-case is one of the ways to implement them.
# In a menu-driven program, the user is given a set of choices of things to do (the menu) and then is asked to select a menu item.
# There are 2 choices in the menu:
# Choice 1 is to find the area of a circle having radius 'r'.
# Choice 2 is to find the area of a rectangle having dimensions 'l' and 'b'.
# You are given the choice 'ch' and an array 'a'.
# If ‘ch’ is 1, ‘a’ contains a single number ‘r’. If ‘ch’ is 2, ‘a’ contains 2 numbers, ‘l’ and ‘b’.
# Consider the choice and print the appropriate area.
# Example :
# Input: ‘ch’ = 2 and ‘a’ = [3, 2]
# Output: area = 6
# Explanation: Since the choice ‘ch’ is 2, we have to print the area of the rectangle having ‘l’ = 3 and ‘b’ = 2, which is 6.
# Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
# Sample Input 1:
# 2
# 3 2

# Sample Output 1:
# 6.00000

# Explanation of sample input 1 :
# Since the choice ‘ch’ is 2, we have to print the area of the rectangle having ‘l’ = 3 and ‘b’ = 2, which is 6.
# Sample Input 2:
# 1
# 3

# Sample Output 2:
# 28.27433

# Explanation of sample input 2 :
# Since the choice ‘ch’ is 1, we have to print the area of the circle having ‘r’ = 3, which is approximately 28.274333882308138. Rounded off to 5 decimal places, we get 28.27433.
# Expected time complexity :
# The expected time complexity is O(1).
# Constraints :
# 1 <= ‘ch’ <= 2
# 1 <= ‘r’ <= 100
# 1 <= ‘l’, ‘b’ <= 100
# Time limit: 1 second
# code :
from typing import *
import math
def areaSwitchCase(ch: int, a: List[float]):
    # Write your code here
    area = 0.0
    if ch == 1:
        # Calculate the area of a circle.
        r = a[0]
        area = math.pi * r * r
    if ch == 2:
        # Calculate the area of a rectangle.
        l = a[0]
        b = a[1]
        area = l * b
    
    # Print the area formatted to five decimal places
    return "{:.5f}".format(area)
