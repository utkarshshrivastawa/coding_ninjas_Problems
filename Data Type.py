# Problem statement
# Data type refers to the type of value a variable has and the way the computer interprets it.
# Each data type has a different size. You’ve studied 5 different data types and the sizes of the data types:

# Integer: 4 bytes
# Long: 8 bytes
# Float: 4 bytes
# Double: 8 bytes
# Character: 1 byte
# You’re given a data type. Print its size in bytes.

# Example :
# Input: Long

# Output: 8

# Explanation: The size of a Long variable is given as 8 bytes.
# Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
# Sample Input 1:
# Long
# Sample Output 1:
# 8
# Explanation of sample input 1 :
# The size of a Long variable is given as 8 bytes.
# Sample Input 2:
# Float
# Sample Output 2:
# 4
# Explanation of sample input 2 :
# The size of a Float variable is given as 4 bytes.
# Expected time complexity :
# The expected time complexity is O(1).
# Constraints :
# ‘type’ is one of the data types given above.
# Time limit: 1 second

Code:
from typing import *  
data = {'Integer':4, 'Long':8, 'Float':4 ,'Double':8 ,'Character':1}
def dataTypes(type):
    return data.get(type)
